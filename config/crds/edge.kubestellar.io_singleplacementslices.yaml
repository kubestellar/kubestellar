        description: SinglePlacementSlice holds results of resolving a "where predicate".
          For a given EdgePlacement object, the Where Resolver figures out which Locations
          match that EdgePlacement and selects the SyncTarget to use within that Location,
          then puts these results into some SinglePlacementSlice API objects. We use
          potentially multiple API objects so that no one of them has to get very
          big.
