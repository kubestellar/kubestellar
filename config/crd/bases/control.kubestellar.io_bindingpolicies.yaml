              wantSingletonReportedState:
                description: WantSingletonReportedState means that for objects that
                  are distributed --- taking all BindingPolicies into account ---
                  to exactly one WEC, the object's reported state from the WEC should
                  be written to the object in its WDS. WantSingletonReportedState
                  connotes an expectation that indeed the object will propagate to
                  exactly one WEC, but there is no guaranteed reaction when this expectation
                  is not met.
