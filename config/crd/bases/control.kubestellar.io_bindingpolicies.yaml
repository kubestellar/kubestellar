                        `resources` is a list of lowercase plural names for the sorts of objects to match.
                        An entry of `"*"` means that all match.
                        If this list contains `"*"` then it should contain nothing else.
                        Empty list is a special case, it matches every object.

                      description: |-
                        WantSingletonReportedState, in short, indicates an expectation
                        that the matching workload objects are distributed to exactly one WEC
                        and requests that the `.status` of such objects propagate from the WEC
                        to the WDS.

                        For a precise description, start with a couple of definitions.
                        For a given workload object, _singleton status return is requested_
                        if and only if there exists at least one BindingPolicy or Binding
                        that has `wantSingletonReportedState==true` in a clause that
                        matches/references the workload object.

                        The _qualified WEC set_ of a workload object is the set of WECs that are
                        associated with that workload object by at least one BindingPolicy or Binding
                        that has `wantSingletonReportedState==true` in a clause that
                        matches/references the workload object.

                        For a given workload object, while singleton status return is requested,
                        KubeStellar maintains a label on the object whose name (key) is
                        `kubestellar.io/executing-count` and whose value is a string representation
                        of the size of the qualified WEC set of that object.
                        While singleton status return is _not_ requested, KubeStellar suppresses
                        the existence of a label with that name (key).
                        While singleton status return is requested _and_ the size of the qualified
                        WEC set is 1, KubeStellar propagates the object's `.status` from that WEC
                        to the `.status` section of the object in the WDS.
                        While either singleton status return is NOT requested or the size of the
                        qualified WEC set is NOT 1, there is nothing in the `.status` of the object
                        in the WDS that was propagated there from a WEC by KubeStellar.
