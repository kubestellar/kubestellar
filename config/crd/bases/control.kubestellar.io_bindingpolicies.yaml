                        `resources` is a list of lowercase plural names for the sorts of objects to match.
                        An entry of `"*"` means that all match.
                        If this list contains `"*"` then it should contain nothing else.
                        Empty list is a special case, it matches every object.

                      description: |-
                        WantMultiWECReportedState requests that the `.status` from the
                        workload object in each WEC where that object is present be combined
                        and returned into the `.status` of the object in the WDS. For a precise
                        definition of how this interacts with `.wantSingletonReportedState`,
                        see the comment on that field.


                        If the object's kind is one of the few that this feature handles specially
                        then the aggregation is done with awareness of, and consideration for,
                        the semantics of their `.status` sections;
                        for the rest, the aggregation is done by simple general-purpose rules.
                        The basis of the aggregation logic is explained in the docs.

                    wantSingletonReportedState:
                      description: |-
                        WantSingletonReportedState, in short, indicates an expectation
                        that the matching workload objects are distributed to exactly one WEC
                        and requests that the `.status` of such objects propagate from the WEC
                        to the WDS.


                        For a precise description of this field and how it interacts with
                        WantMultiWECReportedState, start with a few definitions.


                        For a given workload object, _singleton status return is requested_
                        if and only if there exists at least one BindingPolicy or Binding
                        that has `wantSingletonReportedState==true` in a clause that
                        matches/references the workload object.


                        For a given workload object, _multi-WEC status return is requested_
                        if and only if there exists at least one BindingPolicy or Binding
                        that has `wantMultiWECReportedState==true` in a clause that
                        matches/references the workload object.


                        The _qualified singleton WEC set_ of a workload object is the set of WECs that are
                        associated with that workload object by at least one BindingPolicy or Binding
                        that has `wantSingletonReportedState==true` in a clause that
                        matches/references the workload object.


                        The _qualified WEC set_ of a workload object is the set of WECs that are
                        associated with that workload object by at least one BindingPolicy or Binding
                        that has EITHER `wantSingletonReportedState==true`
                        OR `wantMultiWECReportedState==true` in a clause that
                        matches/references the workload object.


                        For a given workload object, while singleton status return is requested,
                        KubeStellar maintains a label on the object whose name (key) is
                        `kubestellar.io/executing-count` and whose value is a string representation
                        of the size of the qualified WEC set of that object.
                        While singleton status return is _not_ requested, KubeStellar suppresses
                        the existence of a label with that name (key).


                        While either singleton or multi-WEC status return is requested on an object
                        and the size of the object's qualified WEC set is 1, KubeStellar
                        propagates the object's `.status` from that WEC
                        to the `.status` section of the object in the WDS.


                        While multi-WEC status return is requested on an object and the size of
                        the object's qualified WEC set is greater than 1, KubeStellar combines
                        the `.status` of the object from each of those WECs and puts the
                        combination in the `.status` of the object in the WDS.


                        While neither of the above two conditions is true,
                        there is nothing in the `.status` of the object
                        in the WDS that was propagated there from a WEC by KubeStellar.
