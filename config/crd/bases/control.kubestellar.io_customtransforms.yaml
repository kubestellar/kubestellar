          CustomTransform describes how to select and transform some objects
          on their way from WDS to WEC, without regard to the WEC (i.e.,
          not changes that are specific to the individual WEC).
          The transformation specified here is in addition to, and follows,
          whatever is built into KubeStellar for that object.

              APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.
              Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and
              may reject unrecognized values.

              Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents.
              Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to.

              In CamelCase.

              CustomTransformSpec selects some objects and describes how to transform them.
              The selected objects are those that match the `apiGroup` and `resource` fields.

              apiGroup:
                description: '`apiGroup` holds just the group, not also the version'

              remove:
                description: |-
                  `remove` is a list of JSONPath expressions (https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/)
                  that identify part of the object to remove if present.
                  Only a subset of JSONPath is supported.
                  The expression used in a filter must be a conjunction of field == literal tests.
                  Examples:
                  - "$.spec.resources.GenericItems[*].generictemplate.metadata.resourceVersion"
                  - "$.store.book[?(@.author == 'Kilgore Trout' && @.category == 'fiction')].price"
                items:
                  type: string
                type: array
              resource:
                description: |-
                  `resource` is the lowercase plural way of identifying a sort of object.
                  "subresources" can not be directly bound to, only whole (top-level) objects.
