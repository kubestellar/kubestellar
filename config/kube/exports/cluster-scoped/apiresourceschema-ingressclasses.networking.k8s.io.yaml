        the Ingress Spec. The `ingressclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class` annotation
        can be used to indicate that an IngressClass should be considered default.
        When a single IngressClass resource has this annotation set to true, new Ingress
        resources without a class specified will be assigned this default class.
