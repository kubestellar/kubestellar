        description: RuntimeClass defines a class of container runtime supported in
          the cluster. The RuntimeClass is used to determine which container runtime
          is used to run all containers in a pod. RuntimeClasses are manually defined
          by a user or cluster provisioner, and referenced in the PodSpec. The Kubelet
          is responsible for resolving the RuntimeClassName reference before running
          the pod.  For more details, see https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/runtime-class/

              possible values are specific to the node & CRI configuration.  It is
              assumed that all handlers are available on every node, and handlers
              of the same name are equivalent on every node. For example, a handler
              called "runc" might specify that the runc OCI runtime (using native
              Linux containers) will be used to run the containers in a pod. The Handler
              must be lowercase, conform to the DNS Label (RFC 1123) requirements,
              and is immutable.

                    taint that matches the triple <key,value,effect> using the matching

                    effect:
                      description: |-
                        Effect indicates the taint effect to match. Empty means match all taint effects. When specified, allowed values are NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule and NoExecute.

                        Possible enum values:
                         - `"NoExecute"` Evict any already-running pods that do not tolerate the taint. Currently enforced by NodeController.
                         - `"NoSchedule"` Do not allow new pods to schedule onto the node unless they tolerate the taint, but allow all pods submitted to Kubelet without going through the scheduler to start, and allow all already-running pods to continue running. Enforced by the scheduler.
                         - `"PreferNoSchedule"` Like TaintEffectNoSchedule, but the scheduler tries not to schedule new pods onto the node, rather than prohibiting new pods from scheduling onto the node entirely. Enforced by the scheduler.

                        operator must be Exists; this combination means to match all
                        values and all keys.

                      description: |-
                        Operator represents a key's relationship to the value. Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal. Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can tolerate all taints of a particular category.

                        Possible enum values:
                         - `"Equal"`

                        this field is ignored) tolerates the taint. By default, it
                        is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not
                        evict). Zero and negative values will be treated as 0 (evict
                        immediately) by the system.
