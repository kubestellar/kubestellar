                  is based on VersionPriority, ordered highest to lowest (20 before

                  in the 10s. In case of equal version priorities, the version string
                  will be used to compute the order inside a group. If the version
                  string is "kube-like", it will sort above non "kube-like" version
                  strings, which are ordered lexicographically. "Kube-like" versions
                  start with a "v", then are followed by a number (the major version),

                  (the minor version). These are sorted first by GA > beta > alpha
                  (where GA is a version with no suffix such as beta or alpha), and
                  then by comparing major version, then minor version. An example
