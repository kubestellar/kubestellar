        syncing. For a given EdgePlacement object, the scheduler figures out which
        Locations match that EdgePlacement and selects the SyncTarget to use within
        that Location, then puts these results into some SinglePlacementSlice API
        objects. We use potentially multiple API objects so that no one of them has
        to get very big.
