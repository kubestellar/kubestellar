      description: "EdgePlacement exists in the center and binds (a) a collection
        of Locations with (b) both (b1) objects in the center to downsync (propagate
        desired state from center to edge and return reported state from edge toward
        center), and (b2) a way of identifying objects (in edge clusters) to upsync
        (propagate from edge toward center). Both downsyncing and upsyncing are with
        all of the Locations.  This is not entirely unrelated to a TMC Placement,
        which directs the selected Namespaces to propagate to _one_ of the selected
        Locations. \n The objects to downsync are those in selected namespaces plus
        selected non-namespaced objects. \n For upsync, the matching objects originate
        in the edge clusters and propagate to the corresponding mailbox workspaces
        while summaries of them go to the workload management workspace (as prescribed
        by the summarization API). \n Overlap between EdgePlacements is allowed: two
        different EdgePlacement objects may select intersecting Location sets and/or
        intersecting Namespace sets. This is not problematic because: - propagation
        _into_ a destination is additive; - propagation _from_ a source is additive;
        - two directives to propagate the same object to the same destination are
        simply redundant (they, by design, can not conflict)."
