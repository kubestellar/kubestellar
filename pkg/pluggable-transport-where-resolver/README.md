This package is a duplication of `where-resolver`.
In this package we change the implementation so that it maintains the where-resolutions in EdgePlacementDecision 
resources, and not SinglePlacementSlices.


Once this package is code-reviewed and tested, it will be merged into the `where-resolver` package, and then deleted.
