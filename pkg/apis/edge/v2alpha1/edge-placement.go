// EdgePlacement exists in the center and binds (a) a collection of
// Locations with (b) both (b1) objects in the center to downsync
// (propagate desired state from center to edge and return reported
// state from edge toward center), and (b2) a way of identifying objects
// (in edge clusters) to upsync (propagate from edge toward center).
// Both downsyncing and upsyncing are with all of the Locations.  This
// is not entirely unrelated to a TMC Placement, which directs the
// selected Namespaces to propagate to _one_ of the selected
// Locations.
//
// The objects to downsync are those in selected namespaces plus
// selected non-namespaced objects.
//
// For upsync, the matching objects originate in the edge clusters and
// propagate to the corresponding mailbox workspaces while summaries
// of them go to the workload management workspace (as prescribed by
// the summarization API).
//
// Overlap between EdgePlacements is allowed:
// two different EdgePlacement objects may select intersecting Location sets
// and/or intersecting Namespace sets.
// This is not problematic because:
//   - propagation _into_ a destination is additive;
//   - propagation _from_ a source is additive;
//   - two directives to propagate the same object to the same destination are
//     simply redundant (they, by design, can not conflict).
