// Map abstracts reading from a map from Key to Val.
// The Key values must be comparable in some way
// (which is not exposed in this interface).
// The map may or may not vary over time.
// Access through this interface may or may not be thread-safe.
// The continuation passed to ContGet may enable access to
// the Val after return.

	// Users of this map may retain Val values;
	// they are immutable in this shallow sense.
	MapToLocked[Key, Val]

	// Get queries the map with a given key.
	// If the map has a value for that key then that value
	// and `true` are returned; otherwise the zero value of Val
	// and `false` are returned.

	// call to (but not the return from) this method;
	// (b) each of the other calls to the consumer happens after
	// the return from the previous call to the consumer; and
	// (c) the return from this call happens after the return from
	// the last call to consumer.
	// The consumer may or may not be allowed to access the map
	// (comments on particular maps should say whether such access is allowed).
	// The consumer may or may not be allowed to enable access
	// to the Val after returning (commands on particular maps should say).
