package placement

// This package contains the functionality of the placement translator.
// See declarations.go for how it is factored into big pieces.

//
// This package also contains some generic operations directly on
// Go data structures.

// Generic ops on slices:
// - SliceCopy.
// - SliceContains.
// - SliceContainsParametric.
// - SliceRemoveFunctional.
// - SliceEqual.
// - SliceApply applies a 1-arg 0-result fn to elts of a slice.

//
// This package also contains some generic types and functions for
// general-purpose logic.

//   two values in a partial order.

//
// This package also contains generic types and functions for relational algebra.
// This consists of the following.

// The collection interfaces here are not specific about concurrency:
// some implementations are safe for concurrent access, and some are not.

// Tuple types: Pair, Triple, and Quad; in tuples.go.
// All of the generics here have a fixed number of type parameters
// because Go does not allow a variable number of type parameters.
