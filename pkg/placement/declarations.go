// This file contains declarations of the interfaces between the main parts
// of the placement translator.  Those are as follows.
//
// - a WhereResolver that monitors the "where" resolutions in the
//   SinglePlacementSlice API objects.
// - a WhatResolver that monitors the EdgePlacement objects and resolves
//   their "what" predicates.
// - a SetBinder that keeps track of the bindings between resolved where
//   and resolved what.
// - a WorkloadProjector that maintains the customized workload copies
//   and syncer configuration objects in the mailbox workspaces.

// We are talking here about an assembly of several components, each
// of which likely has private data protected by a mutex.
// We thus must pay attention to avoiding deadlock.
// We do that by declaring and respecting a partial order among mutexes.
// When we say that mutex A precedes B in the locking order, this means that
// it is forbidden for a goroutine to invoke `A.Lock()` while holding B locked.
// Stated in a positive but little less precise way: a goroutine that is
// going to lock both A and B must lock A first.

// The particular locking order chosen here generally follows the pattern
// that components that drive activity precede components that get driven,
// so that this relationship can be synchronous.  For example, providers
// of maps generally precede clients of those maps.
