For your convenience you will probably want to add contexts to your
kubeconfig named after the non-host-type control planes (WDSes and
ITSes) that you just created (a host-type control plane is just an
alias for the KubeFlex hosting cluster). You can do that with the
following `kflex` commands; each creates a context and makes it the
current one. See
https://github.com/kubestellar/kubestellar/blob/{{ .Values.KUBESTELLAR_VERSION }}/docs/content/direct/core-chart.md#kubeconfig-files-and-contexts-for-control-planes
for a way to do this without using `kflex`.
Start by setting your current kubeconfig context to the one you used
when installing this chart.

kubectl config use-context $the_one_where_you_installed_this_chart
kflex ctx --set-current-for-hosting # make sure the KubeFlex CLI's hidden state is right for what the Helm chart just did
{{range $cp := (concat (.Values.ITSes | default list) (.Values.WDSes | default list) ) }}
{{- if ne $cp.type "host" }}
kflex ctx --overwrite-existing-context {{ $cp.name }}
{{- end }}
{{- end }}

To debug the Kubestellar controller-manager using `pprof`, forward the debug port (default: 6060) and access it:
```bash
kubectl port-forward <controller-manager-pod> 6060:6060
go tool pprof http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/profile

Finally, you can use `kflex ctx` to switch back to the kubeconfig
context for your KubeFlex hosting cluster.
