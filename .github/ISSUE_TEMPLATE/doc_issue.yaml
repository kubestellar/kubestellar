        Thanks for taking the time to report an issue with the documentation.

        Before opening a new issue, look for an overlapping issue that
        you could contribute to.

        Remember that documentation sources for the website are
        intended to [also render nicely when viewed directly on
        GitHub](https://github.com/kubestellar/kubestellar/blob/main/docs/README.md#dual-use-documentation-sources),
        _to the degree possible_.
