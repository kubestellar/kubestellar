## üõ°Ô∏è DCO Sign-Off

All contributions to KubeStellar require a Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) sign-off. This is a simple way to certify that you wrote or have the right to submit the code you are contributing.

- **How to sign your commits:**
  ```sh
  git commit -s -m "Your commit message"
  ```
- This adds a `Signed-off-by` line to your commit, as required by the [DCO](https://developercertificate.org/).
- Commits without a DCO sign-off will fail automated checks.

## üîó Referencing Issues & EPICs

- Reference related issues and EPICs in your commit messages and pull requests.

  ```

  Addresses #1234. See EPIC #5678.
  ```
- In your PR description, use `Fixes #<issue-number>`, `Closes #<issue-number>`, or `Related to #<issue-number>` to automatically link your PR to issues.

  ```

### Shell Scripts
