# KubeStellar Blog

This section hosts official KubeStellar blog posts.

## Why internal blogs?
Earlier, KubeStellar blog posts were published on external platforms such as Medium.
To improve long-term ownership, accessibility, and discoverability, blog content is
being moved into the official KubeStellar documentation site.

## Migration plan
- New blog posts will be added here.
- Existing Medium posts will be gradually migrated.
- External links will remain available during the transition.

Stay tuned for upcoming posts 🚀
