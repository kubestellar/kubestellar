# KubeStellar Project Governance

The KubeStellar project is dedicated to solving challenges stemming from
multi-cluster configuration management for edge, multi-cloud, and hybrid cloud. 
This governance explains how the project is run.

## Manifesto
 
 * KubeStellar Maintainers strive to be good citizens in the Kubernetes project.
 * KubeStellar Maintainers see KubeStellar always as part of the Kubernetes ecosystem and always 
   strive to keep that ecosystem united. In particular, this means:
   * KubeStellar strives to not divert from Kubernetes, but strives to extend its 
     use-cases to non-container control planes while keeping the ecosystems of 
     libraries and tooling united.
   * KubeStellar – as a consumer of Kubernetes API Machinery – will strive to stay 100% 
     compatible with the semantics of Kubernetes APIs, while removing container 
     orchestration specific functionality.
   * KubeStellar strives to upstream changes to Kubernetes code as much as possible.

## Values

The KubeStellar and its leadership embrace the following values:

 * *Openness*: Communication and decision-making happens in the open and is 
   discoverable for future reference. As much as possible, all discussions and 
   work take place in public forums and open repositories.
 * *Fairness*: All stakeholders have the opportunity to provide feedback and 
   submit contributions, which will be considered on their merits.
 * *Community over Product or Company*: Sustaining and growing our community 
   takes priority over shipping code or sponsors' organizational goals. Each 
   contributor participates in the project as an individual.
 * *Inclusivity*: We innovate through different perspectives and skill sets, 
   which can only be accomplished in a welcoming and respectful environment.
 * *Participation*: Responsibilities within the project are earned through 
   participation, and there is a clear path up the contributor ladder into 
   leadership positions.

## Maintainers

KubeStellar Maintainers have write access to the [project GitHub repository](https://github.com/kubestellar/kubestellar).
They can merge their own patches or patches from others. The current maintainers
can be found as top-level approvers in [OWNERS](https://github.com/kubestellar/kubestellar/blob/main/OWNERS).  Maintainers collectively 
manage the project's resources and contributors.

This privilege is granted with some expectation of responsibility: maintainers
are people who care about the KubeStellar project and want to help it grow and
improve. A maintainer is not just someone who can make changes, but someone who
has demonstrated their ability to collaborate with the team, get the most
knowledgeable people to review code and docs, contribute high-quality code, and
follow through to fix issues (in code or tests).

A maintainer is a contributor to the project's success and a citizen helping
the project succeed.

The collective team of all Maintainers is known as the Maintainer Council, which 
is the governing body for the project.

## Becoming a Maintainer

<!-- If you have full Contributor Ladder documentation that covers becoming
a Maintainer or Owner, then this section should instead be a reference to that
documentation -->

To become a Maintainer you need to demonstrate the following:

  * commitment to the project:
    * participate in discussions, contributions, code and documentation reviews
      for 3 months or more,
    * perform reviews for 5 non-trivial pull requests,
    * contribute 5 non-trivial pull requests and have them merged,
  * ability to write quality code and/or documentation,
  * ability to collaborate with the team,
  * understanding of how the team works (policies, processes for testing and code review, etc),
  * understanding of the project's code base and coding and documentation style.
  <!-- add any additional Maintainer requirements here -->

A new Maintainer must be proposed by an existing maintainer by sending a message to the
[developer mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/kubestellar-dev). A simple majority 
vote of existing Maintainers approves the application.

Maintainers who are selected will be granted the necessary GitHub rights,
and invited to the [private maintainer mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/kubestellar-dev-private).

### Bootstrapping Maintainers

To bootstrap the process, 3 maintainers are defined (in the initial PR adding 
this to the repository) that do not necessarily follow the above rules. When a 
new maintainer is added following the above rules, the existing maintainers 
define one not following the rules to step down, until all of them follow the 
rules.

### Removing a Maintainer

Maintainers may resign at any time if they feel that they will not be able to 
continue fulfilling their project duties.

Maintainers may also be removed after being inactive, failure to fulfill their 
Maintainer responsibilities, violating the Code of Conduct, or other reasons. 
Inactivity is defined as a period of very low or no activity in the project for 
a year or more, with no definite schedule to return to full Maintainer activity.

A Maintainer may be removed at any time by a 2/3 vote of the remaining maintainers.

Depending on the reason for removal, a Maintainer may be converted to Emeritus 
status. Emeritus Maintainers will still be consulted on some project matters, 
and can be rapidly returned to Maintainer status if their availability changes.


## Meetings

Time zones permitting, Maintainers are expected to participate in the public 
community call meeting. Maintainers will also have closed meetings in order to 
discuss security reports or Code of Conduct violations. Such meetings should be 
scheduled by any Maintainer on receipt of a security issue or CoC report. 
All current Maintainers must be invited to such closed meetings, except for any 
Maintainer who is accused of a CoC violation.

## Code of Conduct

<!-- This assumes that your project does not have a separate Code of Conduct
Committee; most maintainer-run projects do not.  Remember to place a link
to the private Maintainer mailing list or alias in the code-of-conduct file.-->

[Code of Conduct](coc.md)
violations by community members will be discussed and resolved
on the [private Maintainer mailing list](https://groups.google.com/u/1/g/kubestellar-dev-private).

## Security Response Team

The Maintainers will appoint a Security Response Team to handle security reports.
This committee may simply consist of the Maintainer Council themselves. If this 
responsibility is delegated, the Maintainers will appoint a team of at least two 
contributors to handle it. The Maintainers will review who is assigned to this 
at least once a year.

The Security Response Team is responsible for handling all reports of security 
holes and breaches according to the [security policy](security/security.md).

## Voting

While most business in KubeStellar is conducted by "lazy consensus", periodically
the Maintainers may need to vote on specific actions or changes.
A vote can be taken on [the developer mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/kubestellar-dev) or
[the private Maintainer mailing list](https://groups.google.com/u/1/g/kubestellar-dev-private)
for security or conduct matters.  Votes may also be taken at the community call 
meeting. Any Maintainer may demand a vote be taken.

Most votes require a simple majority of all Maintainers to succeed. Maintainers
can be removed by a 2/3 majority vote of all Maintainers, and changes to this
Governance require a 2/3 vote of all Maintainers.

## Modifying this Charter

Changes to this Governance and its supporting documents may be approved by a 
2/3 vote of the Maintainers.
