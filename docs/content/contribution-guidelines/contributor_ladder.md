# Maintainer Pathway – KubeStellar

This document outlines the process by which contributors to the [KubeStellar](https://github.com/kubestellar/kubestellar) open source project can progress toward becoming maintainers, and defines a transparent, merit-based path that rewards consistent engagement and community contribution.

---

## Purpose

To provide contributors with a clear understanding of how to grow within the KubeStellar community — from first-time contributors to trusted maintainers — based on mentorship, impact, and measurable contributions.

## Contributor Journey

Each level reflects a growing commitment to the project, increased responsibilities, and expanded leadership opportunities.

## Maintainer Activity Requirements

Maintainers are expected to remain active by meeting the following **bi-monthly (every 2 months)** contribution minimums:

| Metric                                | Requirement (Per 2 Months) |
|---------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| “Help Wanted” Issues                  | ≥ 2                        |
| **PRs Merged**                        | ≥ 3                        |
| PR Reviews or Constructive Comments   | ≥ 8                        |
| Community Meeting Attendance          | ≥ 3                        |

All maintainers will be listed in a shared Google Sheet where these metrics are tracked publicly.

---

## Evaluation and Status

- Evaluations occur every 6 weeks for interns and every 8 weeks for maintainers
- Interns who do not meet the required output may be removed from the program
- Maintainers who fail to meet activity thresholds for 2 consecutive cycles will be reviewed for possible status change
- Contributors may re-enter or regain status based on future contributions

---

## Metric Tracking

Contribution metrics will be gathered via GitHub API and updated to a public Google Sheet (link TBD). Contributions across the following repos count toward intern and maintainer totals:

- [`kubestellar/kubestellar`](https://github.com/kubestellar/kubestellar)
- [`kubestellar/kubeflex`](https://github.com/kubestellar/kubeflex)
- [`kubestellar/ui`](https://github.com/kubestellar/ui)
