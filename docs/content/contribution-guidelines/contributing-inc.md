Our [Getting Started](../direct/get-started.md) guide shows a user how to install a simple "kick the tires" instance of KubeStellar using a helm chart and kind.

To set up and test a development system, please refer to the _test/e2e/README.md_ file in the GitHub repository.
After running any of those e2e (end to end) tests you will be left with a running system that can be exercised further.
