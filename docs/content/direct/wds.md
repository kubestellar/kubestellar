# Workload Description Spaces

This document will tell users what they need to know about these.

Including the fact that the KubeFlex hosting cluster can play the role
of WDS, and how to make that happen.

Distinguish between (a) creating some sort of space that can play the role of WDS and (b) registering it with KubeFlex as a ControlPlane and deploying the KubeStellar controllers and related stuff for it.

TODO: write this.
