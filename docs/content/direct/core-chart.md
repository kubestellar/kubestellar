This documents explains how to use KubeStellar Core chart to do three
of the 11 installation and usage steps; please see [the
outline](usage-basics.md) for generalities and [the
quickstart](get-started.md) for an example of usage.

This Helm chart can do any subset of the following things.

- Initialize a pre-existing cluster to serve as the KubeFlex hosting cluster.
- Create some ITSes.
- Create some WDSes.

The information provided is specific for the following release:

```shell
export KUBESTELLAR_VERSION={{ config.ks_latest_release }}
```

## Pre-requisites

To install the Helm chart the only requirement is [Helm](https://helm.sh/).
However, additional executables may be required to create/manage the cluster(s) (_e.g._, Kind and kubectl),
to join Workload Execution Clusters (WEKs) (_e.g._, clusteradm),
and to interact with Control Planes (_e.g._, kubectl), _etc_.
For such purpose, a full list of executable that may be required can be found [here](./pre-reqs.md).

The setup of KubStellar via the Core chart requires the existence of a KubeFlex hosting cluster.

This can be:

1. A local **Kind** or **k3s** cluster with an ingress with SSL passthrough and a mapping to host port 9443

This option is particularly useful for first time users or users that would like to have a local deployment.

It is important to note that, when the hosting cluster was created by **kind** or **k3s** and its Ingress domain name is left to default to localtest.me, then the name of the container running hosting cluster must be also be referenced during the Helm chart installation by setting `--set "kubeflex-controller.hostContainer=<control-plane-container-name>"`.
The `<control-plane-container-name>` is the name of the container in which kind or k3d is running the relevant control plane. One may use `docker ps` to find the `<control-plane-container-name>`.

If a host port number different from the expected 9443 is used for the Kind cluster, then the same port number must be specified during the chart installation by adding the following argument `--set "kubeflex-controller.externalPort=<port>"`.

By default the KubeStelalr Core chart uses a test domain `localtest.me`, which is ok for testing on a single host machine. However, scenarios that span more than one machine, it is necessary to set `--set "kubeflex-controller.domain=<domain>"` to a more appropriate `<domain>` that can be reached from Workload Execution CLusters (WECs).

For convenience, a new local **Kind** cluster that satisfies the requirements for KubeStellar setup
and that can be used to exercises the [examples](./examples.md) can be created with the following command:

```shell
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubestellar/kubestellar/v{{ config.ks_latest_release }}/scripts/create-kind-cluster-with-SSL-passthrough.sh) --name kubeflex --port 9443
```

Alternatively, a new local **k3s** cluster that satisfies the requirements for KubeStellar setup
and that can be used to exercises the [examples](./examples.md) can be created with the following command:

```shell
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubestellar/kubestellar/v{{ config.ks_latest_release }}/scripts/create-k3s-cluster-with-SSL-passthrough.sh) --port 9443
```

3. An **OpenShift** cluster

When using this option, one is required to explicitely set the `isOpenShift` variable to `true` by including `--set "kubeflex-operator.isOpenShift=true"` in the Helm chart installation command.

## KubeStellar Core Chart values

The KubeStellar chart makes available to the user several values that may be used to customize its installation into an existing cluster:

```yaml
# KubeFlex override values
kubeflex-operator:
  install: true # enable/disable the installation of KubeFlex by the chart (default: true)
  installPostgreSQL: true # enable/disable the installation of the appropriate version of PostgreSQL required by KubeFlex (default: true)
  isOpenShift: false # set this variable to true when installing the chart in an OpenShift cluster (default: false)
  # Kind cluster specific settings:
  domain: localtest.me # used to define the DNS domain name used from outside the KubeFlex hosting cluster to reach that cluster's Ingress endpoint (default: localtest.me)
  externalPort: 9443 # used to set the port to access the Control Planes API (default: 9443)
  hostContainer: kubeflex-control-plane # used to set the name of the container that runs the KubeFlex hosting cluster (default: kubeflex-control-plane, which corresponds to a Kind cluster with name kubeflex)

# Determine if the Post Create Hooks should be installed by the chart
InstallPCHs: true

# List the Inventory and Transport Spaces (ITSes) to be created by the chart
# Each ITS consists of a mandatory unique name and an optional type, which could be either host or vcluster (default to vcluster, if not specified)
ITSes: # ==> installs ocm + ocm-status-addon

# List the Workload Description Spaces (WDSes) to be created by the chart
# Each WDS consists of a mandatory unique name and several optional parameters:
# - type: host or k8s (default to k8s, if not specified)
# - APIGroups: a comma separated list of APIGroups
# - ITSName: the name of the ITS control plane to be used by the WDS. Note that the ITSName MUST be specified if more than one ITS exists.
WDSes: # ==> installs kubestellar + ocm-transport-plugin
```

The first section of the `values.yaml` file refers to parameters that are specific to the KubeFlex instllation, see [here](https://github.com/kubestellar/kubeflex/blob/main/docs/users.md) for more information.

In particular:
- `kubeflex-operator.install` accepts a boolean value to enable/disable the installation of KubeFlex into the cluster by the chart
- `kubeflex-operator.isOpenShift` must be set to true by the user when installing the chart into a OpenShift cluster

By default, the chart will install the KubeFlex and its PostgreSQL dependency.

The second section allows a user of the chart to determine if Post Create Hooks (PCHs) needed for creating ITSes and WDSes control planes should be instlalled by the chart. By default `InstallPCHs` is set to `true` to enable the instllation of the PCHs, however one may want to set this value to `false` when installing multiple copies of the chart to avoid conflicts. A single copy of the PCHs is required and allowed per cluster.

The third section of the `values.yaml` file allows one to create a list of Inventory and Transport Spaces (ITSes). By default, this list is empty and no ITS will be created by the chart. A list of ITSes can be specified using the following format:

```yaml
ITSes: # all the CPs in this list will execute the its.yaml PCH
  - name: <its1>          # mandatory name of the control plane
    type: <vlcuster|host> # optional type of control plane host or vcluster (default to vcluster, if not specified)
  - name: <its2>          # mandatory name of the control plane
    type: <vlcuster|host> # optional type of control plane host or vcluster (default to vcluster, if not specified)
  ...
```

where `name` must specify a name unique among all the control planes in that KubeFlex deployment and the optional `type` can be either vlcuster (default) or host, see [here](https://github.com/kubestellar/kubeflex/blob/main/docs/users.md) for more information.

The fourth section of the `values.yaml` file allows one to create a list of Workload Description Spaces (WDSes). By default, this list is empty and no WDS will be created by the chart. A list of WDSes can be specified using the following format:

```yaml
WDSes: # all the CPs in this list will execute the wds.yaml PCH
  - name: <wds1>     # mandatory name of the control plane
    type: <host|k8s> # optional type of control plane host or k8s (default to k8s, if not specified)
    APIGroups: ""    # optional string holding a comma-separated list of APIGroups
    ITSName: <its1>  # optional name of the ITS control plane, this MUST be specified if more than one ITS exists at the moment the WDS PCH starts
  - name: <wds2>     # mandatory name of the control plane
    type: <host|k8s> # optional type of control plane host or k8s (default to k8s, if not specified)
    APIGroups: ""    # optional string holding a comma-separated list of APIGroups
    ITSName: <its2>  # optional name of the ITS control plane, this MUST be specified if more than one ITS exists at the moment the WDS PCH starts
  ...
```

where `name` must specify a name unique among all the control planes in that KubeFlex deployment (note that this must be unique among both ITSes and WDSes), the optional `type` can be either k8s (default) or host, see [here](https://github.com/kubestellar/kubeflex/blob/main/docs/users.md) for more information, the optional `APIGroups` provides a list of APIGroups, see [here](https://docs.kubestellar.io/release-{{ config.ks_latest_release }}/direct/examples/#scenario-2-using-the-hosting-cluster-as-wds-to-deploy-a-custom-resource) for more information, and `ITSName` specify the ITS connected to the new WDS being created (this parameter MUST be specified if more that one ITS exists in the cluster, if no value is specified and only one ITS exists in the cluster, then it will be automatically selected).

## KubeStellar Core Chart usage

A specific version of the KubeStellar core chart can be simply installed in an existing cluster using the following command:

```shell
helm upgrade --install ks-core oci://ghcr.io/kubestellar/kubestellar/core-chart --version $KUBESTELLAR_VERSION
```

The above command will install KubeFlex and the Post Create Hooks, but no Control Planes.
Please remeber to add `--set "kubeflex-operator.isOpenShift=true"`, when installing into an OpenShift cluster.

User defined control planes can be added using additional value files of `--set` arguments, _e.g._:

- add a single ITS named its1 of default vcluster type: `--set-json='ITSes=[{"name":"its1"}]'`
- add two ITSes named its1 and its2 of of type vlcuster and host, respectevely: `--set-json='ITSes=[{"name":"its1"},{"name":"its2","type":"host"}]'`
- add a single WDS named wds1 of default k8s type connected to the one and only ITS: `--set-json='WDSes=[{"name":"wds1"}]'`

A KubeStellar Core installation compatible with the common setup suitable for Common Setup described in the [examples](./examples.md) could be achieved with the following command:

```shell
helm upgrade --install ks-core oci://ghcr.io/kubestellar/kubestellar/core-chart --version $KUBESTELLAR_VERSION \
  --set-json='ITSes=[{"name":"its1"}]' \
  --set-json='WDSes=[{"name":"wds1"}]'
```

After the initial instllation is completed, there are two main ways to install additional control planes (_e.g._, create a second `wds2` WDS):

1. Upgrade the initial chart. This choice requires to relist the existing control planes, which would otherwise be deleted:

```shell
helm upgrade --install ks-core oci://ghcr.io/kubestellar/kubestellar/core-chart --version $KUBESTELLAR_VERSION \
  --set-json='ITSes=[{"name":"its1"}]' \
  --set-json='WDSes=[{"name":"wds1"},{"name":"wds2"}]'
```

2. Install a new chart with a different name. This choice does not requires to relist the existing control planes, but requies to disable the reinstallation of KubeFlex and PCHs:

```shell
helm upgrade --install add-wds2 oci://ghcr.io/kubestellar/kubestellar/core-chart --version $KUBESTELLAR_VERSION \
  --set='kubeflex-operator.install=false,InstallPCHs=false' \
  --set-json='WDSes=[{name":"wds2"}]'
```

## Kubeconfig files and contexts for Control Planes

Unless you are using the `kflex` CLI from release 0.6.2 or later of
KubeFlex, before proceeding further you should wait for each of the
new control planes whose type is not "host" to be "ready". A host type
control plane is an alias for the hosting cluster and is born ready.

The following commands will wait for every ControlPlane to be "ready".

```shell
echo "Waiting for all KubeFlex Control Planes to be Ready:"
for cpname in `kubectl get controlplane -o name`; do
  cpname=${cpname##*/}
  while [[ `kubectl get cp $cpname -o 'jsonpath={..status.conditions[?(@.type=="Ready")].status}'` != "True" ]]; do
    echo "Waiting for \"$cpname\"..."
    sleep 5
  done
  echo "\"$cpname\" is ready."
done
```

It is convenient to use one kubeconfig file that has a context for
each of your control planes. That can be done in two ways, one using
the `kflex` CLI and one not.

1. Using `kflex` CLI

    The following commands will add a context, named after the given
    control plane, to your current kubeconfig file and make that the
    current context. The deletion is to remove an older vintage if it
    is present.

    ```shell
    kubectl config delete-context $cpname || true
    kflex ctx $cpname
    ```

    The `kflex ctx` command is unable to create a new context if the
    current context does not access the KubeFlex hosting cluster AND
    the KubeFlex kubeconfig extension remembering that context's name
    is not set; see the KubeFlex user guide for your release of
    KubeFlex for more information.

    To automatically add all Control Planes as contexts of the current kubeconfig, one can use the convenience script below:

    ```shell
    echo "Getting the kubeconfig of all Control Planes..."
    for cpname in `kubectl get controlplane -o name`; do
      cpname=${cpname##*/}
      echo "Getting the kubeconfig of Control Planes \"$cpname\"..."
      kflex ctx $cpname
    done
    ```

    After doing the above context switchery you may wish to use `kflex ctx` to switch back to the hosting cluster context.

    Afterwards the content of a Control Plane `$cpname` can be accessed by specifing its context:

    ```shell
    kubectl --context "$cpname" ...
    ```

2. Using plain `kubectl` commands

    The following commands can be used to create a fresh kubeconfig file for each of the KubeFlex Control Planes in the hosting cluster:

    ```shell
    echo "Creating a kubeconfig for each KubeFlex Control Plane:"
    for cpname in `kubectl get controlplane -o name`; do
      cpname=${cpname##*/}
      echo "Getting the kubeconfig of \"$cpname\" ==> \"kubeconfig-$cpname\"..."
      if [[ "$(kubectl get controlplane $cpname -o=jsonpath='{.spec.type}')" == "host" ]] ; then
        kubectl config view --minify --flatten > "kubeconfig-$cpname"
      else
        kubectl get secret $(kubectl get controlplane $cpname -o=jsonpath='{.status.secretRef.name}') \
          -n $(kubectl get controlplane $cpname -o=jsonpath='{.status.secretRef.namespace}') \
          -o=jsonpath="{.data.$(kubectl get controlplane $cpname -o=jsonpath='{.status.secretRef.key}')}" \
          | base64 -d > "kubeconfig-$cpname"
      fi
      curname=$(kubectl --kubeconfig "kubeconfig-$cpname" config current-context)
      if [ "$curname" != "$cpname" ]
      then kubectl --kubeconfig "kubeconfig-$cpname" config rename-context "$curname" $cpname
      fi
    done
    ```

    The code above puts the kubeconfig for a control plane `$cpname` into a file name `kubeconfig-$cpname` in the local folder.
    The current context will be renamed to `$cpname`, if it does not already have that name (which it will for control planes of type "k8s", for example).

    With the above kubeconfig files in place, the control plane named `$cpname` can be accessed as follows.


    ```shell
    kubectl --kubeconfig "kubeconfig-$cpname" ...
    ```

    The individual kubeconfigs can also be merged as contexts of the current `~/.kube/config` with the following commands:

    ```shell
    echo "Merging the Control Planes kubeconfigs into ~/.kube/config ..."
    cp ~/.kube/config ~/.kube/config.bak
    KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config:$(find . -maxdepth 1 -type f -name 'kubeconfig-*' | tr '\n' ':') kubectl config view --flatten > ~/.kube/kubeconfig-merged
    mv ~/.kube/kubeconfig-merged ~/.kube/config
    ```

    Afterwards the content of a Control Plane `$cpname` can be accessed by specifing its context:

    ```shell
    kubectl --context "$cpname" ...
    ```

## Uninstalling the KubeStellar Core chart

The chart can be uninsitalled using the command:

```shell
helm uninstall ks-core
```

This will remove KubeFlex, PostgreSQL, Post Create Hooks (PCHs), and all KubeFlex Control Planes (_i.e._, ITSes and WDSes) that were created by the chart.

Additionally, if a **Kind** cluster was created with the provide script, it can be deleted with the command:

```shell
kind delete cluster --name kubeflex
```

Alternatively, if a **k3s** cluster was created with the provide script, it can be deleted with the command:

```shell
/usr/local/bin/k3s-uninstall.sh
```
