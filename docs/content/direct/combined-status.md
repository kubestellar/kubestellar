# Combined Status from WECs

Note on terminology: the general idea that we wish to address is returning reported state about a workload object to its WDS. At the current level of development, we equate reported state with the status section of an object --- while anticipating a more general treatment in the future.

There are two methods of returning reported state: a general one and a special case. The general method returns reported state from any number of WECs. The special case applies when the number of WECs is exactly 1, and returns the reported state into the original object in the WDS.

## Introduction to the General Technique

The general technique involves the following ideas.

1. The way that reported state is combined is specified by the user, in a simple but powerful way modeled on SQL. This is chosen because it is a well worked out set of ideas, is widely known, and is something that we may someday want to use in our implementation. We do not need to support anything like full SQL (for any version of SQL). This proposal only involves one particular pattern of relatively simple SELECT statement, and a small subset of the expression language.

1. The specification of how to combine reported state appears in the BindingPolicy objects right next to the criteria for selecting workload objects. This saves users the trouble of having to write selection criteria twice.

1. The combined reported state appears in a new kind of object, one per (workload object, BindingPolicy object) pair.

1. A user can request a list without aggregation, possibly after filtering, but certainly with a limit on list length. The expectation is that such a list makes sense only if the length of the list will be modest. For users that want access to the full reported state from each WEC for a large number of WECs, KubeStellar should have an abstraction that gives the users access --- in a functional way, not by making another copy --- to that state (which is already in the mailbox namespaces).

1. The reported state for a given workload object from a given WEC is implicitly augmented with metadata about the WEC and about the end-to-end propagation from WDS to that WEC. This extra information is available just like the regular contents of the object, for use in combining reported state.

### Relation with SQL

To a given workload object, the user can bind one or more named "status combiners". Each status combiner is analogous to an SQL SELECT statement that does the following things.

1. The SELECT statement has one input table, and that has a row per WEC that the object is prescribed to propagate to.

1. The SELECT statement can have a WHERE clause that filters out some of the rows.

1. The SELECT statmement either does aggregation or does not. In the case of not doing aggregation, the SELECT statement simply has a collection of named expressions defining the columns of its output.

1. In the case of aggregation, the SELECT statement has the following.

    - A `GROUP BY` clause saying how the rows (WECs) are grouped to
      form the inputs for aggregation, in terms of named
      expressions. For convenience here, each of these named
      expressions is implicitly included in the output columns.

    - A collection of named expressions using aggregation functions to define
      additional output columns.

1. The SELECT statement has a LIMIT on the number of rows that it will yield.

## Specification of the general technique

## Examples of using the general technique

### Number of WECs

The NamedStatusCombiner would look like the following.

```yaml
name: numWECs
combinedFields:
- name: count
  type: COUNT
```

### List of stale WECs

This produces a list of WECs for which the core has stale information.

The NamedStatusCombiner would look like the following.

```yaml
name: staleOnes
filter:
  op: Path
  path: "$.propagation.stale"
select:
  op: Path
  path: "$.inventory.name"
```

### Histogram of Pod phase

The NamedStatusCombiner would look like the following.

```yaml
name: podPhase
groupBy:
- name: phase
  def:
    op: Path
    path: "$.status.phase"
combinedFields:
- name: count
  type: COUNT
```

### Histogram of number of available replicas of a Deployment

This reports, for each number of available replicas, how many WECs have that number.

```yaml
name: availableReplicasHistogram
groupBy:
- name: numAvailable
  def:
    op: Path
    path: "$.status.availableReplicas"
combinedFields:
- name: count
  type: COUNT
```

### List of WECs where the Deployment is not fully available

```yaml
name: sadOnes
filter:
  op: Not
  args:
  - op: Equal
    args:
    - op: Path
      path: "$.spec.replicas"
    - op: Path
      path: "$.status.availableReplicas"
select:
- name: wec
  def:
    op: Path
    path: "$.inventory.name"
```

### Full status from each WEC

This produces a listing of object status paired with inventory object name.

```yaml
name: fullStatus
select:
- name: wec
  def:
    op: Path
    path: "$.inventory.name"
- name: status
  def:
    op: Path
    path: "$.status"
```

## Special case for 1 WEC

This proposal refines the meaning of `BindingPolicySpec.WantSingletonReportedState` to request the special case when it applies.
