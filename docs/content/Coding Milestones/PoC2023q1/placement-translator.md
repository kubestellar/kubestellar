The placement translator runs in the center and translates EMC placement problems into edge sync problems.

## Status

The placement translator is a work in progress.  It maintains
`SyncerConfig` objects and downsynced objects in mailbox workspaces,
albeit with limitations discussed in the next section.

## Additional Design Details

The placement translator maintains one `SyncerConfig` object in each
mailbox workspace.  That object is named `the-one`.  Other
`SyncerConfig` objects may exist; the placement translator ignores
them.

The placement translator responds to each resource discovery
independently.  This makes the behavior jaggy and the logging noisy.
For example, it means that the `SyncerConfig` objects may be rewritten
for each resource discovery.  But eventually the right things happen.

The placement translator does not yet attempt the full prescribed
technique for picking the API version to use when reading and writing.
Currently it looks only at the preferred version reported in each
workload management workspace, and only succeeds if they all agree.

One detail left vague in the design outline is what constitutes the
"desired state" that propagates from center to edge.  The easy obvious
answer is the "spec" section of downsynced objects, but that answer
ignores some issues.  Following is the current full answer.

When creating a workload object in a mailbox workspace, the placement
translator uses a copy of the object read from the workload management
workspace but with the following changes.

- The `metadata.managedFields` is emptied.
- The `metadata.resourceVersion` is emptied.
- The `metadata.selfLlink` is emptied.
- The `metadata.uid` is emptied.
- The `metadata.ownerReferences` is emptied.  (Doing better would
  require tracking UID mappings from WMW to MBWS.)
- In `metadata.labels`, `edge.kcp.io/projected=yes` is added.

The placement translator does not react to changes to the workload
objects in the mailbox workspace.

When downsyncing desired state and the placement translator finds the
object already exists in the mailbox workspace, the placement
translator does an HTTP PUT (`Update` in the
`k8s.io/client-go/dynamic` package) using an object value --- called
below the "destination" object --- constructed by reading the object
from the MBWS and making the following changes.

- For top-level sections in the source object other than `apiVersion`,
  `kind`, `metadata`, and `status`, the destination object gets the
  same contents for that section.
- If the source object has some annotations then they are merged into
  the destination object annotations as follows.
  - A destination annotation that has no corresponding annotation in
    the source is unchanged.
  - A destination annotation that has the same value as the
    corresponding annotation in the source is unchanged.
  - A "system" annotation is unchanged.  The system annotations are
    those whose key (a) starts with `kcp.io/` or other stuff followed
    by `.kcp.io/` and (b) does not start with `edge.kcp.io/`.
- The source object's labels are merged into the destination object
  using the same rules as for annotations, and `edge.kcp.io/projected`
  is set to `yes`.
- The remainder of the `metadata` is unchanged.

For objects --- other than `Namespace` objects --- that exist in a
mailbox workspace and whose API GroupResource has been relevant to the
placement translator since it started, ones that have the
`edge.kcp.io/projected=yes` label but are not currently desired are
deleted.  The exclusion for `Namespace` objects is there because the
placement translator does not take full ownership of them, rather it
takes the position that there might be other parties that create
`Namespace` objects or rely on their existence.

## Usage

The placement translator needs three kube client configurations.  One
points to the edge service provider workspace and provides authority
to write into the mailbox workspaces.  Another points to the kcp
server base (i.e., does not identify a particular logical cluster nor
`*`) and is authorized to read all clusters.  In the kubeconfig
created by `kcp start` that is satisfied by the context named
`system:admin`.  The third points to the "scheduling service provider
workspace", the one that has the APIExport of `scheduling.kcp.io`.
This is normally `root`, which has all the kcp APIExports, and the
context named `root` in the kubeconfig created by `kcp start`
satisfies this.

The command line flags, beyond the basics, are as follows.  For a
string parameter, if no default is explicitly stated then the default
is the empty string, which usually means "not specified here".  For
both kube client configurations, the usual rules apply: first consider
command line parameters, then `$KUBECONFIG`, then `~/.kube/config`.

``` { .bash .no-copy }
      --allclusters-cluster string       The name of the kubeconfig cluster to use for access to all clusters
      --allclusters-context string       The name of the kubeconfig context to use for access to all clusters (default "system:admin")
      --allclusters-kubeconfig string    Path to the kubeconfig file to use for access to all clusters
      --allclusters-user string          The name of the kubeconfig user to use for access to all clusters

      --espw-cluster string              The name of the kubeconfig cluster to use for access to the edge service provider workspace
      --espw-context string              The name of the kubeconfig context to use for access to the edge service provider workspace
      --espw-kubeconfig string           Path to the kubeconfig file to use for access to the edge service provider workspace
      --espw-user string                 The name of the kubeconfig user to use for access to the edge service provider workspace

      --server-bind-address ipport       The IP address with port at which to serve /metrics and /debug/pprof/ (default :10204)

      --sspw-cluster string              The name of the kubeconfig cluster to use for access to the scheduling service provider workspace
      --sspw-context string              The name of the kubeconfig context to use for access to the scheduling service provider workspace (default "root")
      --sspw-kubeconfig string           Path to the kubeconfig file to use for access to the scheduling service provider workspace
      --sspw-user string                 The name of the kubeconfig user to use for access to the scheduling service provider workspace
```

## Try It

The nascent placement translator can be exercised following the
scenario in [example1](../example1).  You will need to run the
scheduler and mailbox controller long enough for them to create what
this scenario calls for, but they can be terminated after that.

{%
   include-markdown "example1-subs/example1-pre-kcp.md"
   start="<!--example1-pre-kcp-start-->"
   end="<!--example1-pre-kcp-end-->"
%}

{%
   include-markdown "example1-subs/example1-start-kcp.md"
   start="<!--example1-start-kcp-start-->"
   end="<!--example1-start-kcp-end-->"
%}

{%
   include-markdown "example1-subs/example1-post-kcp.md"
   start="<!--example1-post-kcp-start-->"
   end="<!--example1-post-kcp-end-->"
%}

Continue to follow the steps until the start of Stage 3 of the
exercise.

{%
   include-markdown "example1-subs/example1-stage-1a.md"
   start="<!--example1-stage-1a-start-->"
   end="<!--example1-stage-1a-end-->"
%}

{%
   include-markdown "example1-subs/example1-stage-1b.md"
   start="<!--example1-stage-1b-start-->"
   end="<!--example1-stage-1b-end-->"
%}

{%
   include-markdown "example1-subs/example1-stage-2.md"
   start="<!--example1-stage-2-start-->"
   end="<!--example1-stage-2-end-->"
%}

Finally run the placement translator from the command line.  That
should look like the following (possibly including some complaints,
which do not necessarily indicate real problems).

{%
   include-markdown "placement-translator-subs/placement-translator-process-start-without-cd-kubestellar.md"
   start="<!--placement-translator-process-start-without-cd-kubestellar-start-->"
   end="<!--placement-translator-process-start-without-cd-kubestellar-end-->"
%}

```

The "Put" log entries with `map="what"` show what the "what resolver" is
reporting.  This reports mappings from `ExternalName` of an
`EdgePlacement` object to the workload parts that that `EdgePlacement`
says to downsync and upsync.

The "Put" log entries with `map="where"` show the
`SinglePlacementSlice` objects associated with each `EdgePlacement`.


Next, using a separate shell, examine the SyncerConfig objects in the
mailbox workspaces.  Make sure to use the same kubeconfig as you use
to run the placement translator, or any other that is pointed at the
edge service provider workspace. The following with switch the focus
to mailbox workspace(s).

You can get a listing of mailbox workspaces, while in the edge service
provider workspace, as follows.

```shell 
kubectl get workspace
```
``` { .bash .no-copy }
NAME                                                       TYPE        REGION   PHASE   URL                                                     AGE
1xpg93182scl85te-mb-5ee1c42e-a7d5-4363-ba10-2f13fe578e19   universal            Ready   https://192.168.58.123:6443/clusters/12zzf3frkqz2yj39   36m
1xpg93182scl85te-mb-e6efb8bd-6755-45ac-b44d-5d38f978f990   universal            Ready   https://192.168.58.123:6443/clusters/2v6wl3x41zxmpmhr   36m
```

Next switch to one of the mailbox workspaces (in my case I picked the
one for the guilder cluster) and examine the `SyncerConfig` object.
That should look like the following.

```shell
kubectl ws $(kubectl get workspace | sed -n '2p' | awk '{print $1}')
```
``` { .bash .no-copy }
Current workspace is "root:espw:1xpg93182scl85te-mb-5ee1c42e-a7d5-4363-ba10-2f13fe578e19" (type root:universal).
```

```shell
kubectl get SyncerConfig the-one -o yaml                           
```
``` { .bash .no-copy }

    names:
    - george
    - cosmo
    namespaces:
    - orbital
    resources:
    - sprockets
    - flanges
status: {}
```


At this point you might veer off from the example scenario and try
tweaking things.  For example, try deleting an EdgePlacement as
follows.

```shell
kubectl ws root:my-org:wmw-c
```
``` { .bash .no-copy }
Current workspace is "root:work-c"
```
```shell
kubectl delete EdgePlacement edge-placement-c
```
``` { .bash .no-copy }
edgeplacement.edge.kcp.io "edge-placement-c" deleted
```

That will cause the placement translator to log updates, as follows.

``` { .bash .no-copy }
I0412 15:20:43.129842   94634 map-types.go:338] "Put" map="what" key="1i1weo8uoea04wxr:edge-placement-c" val={Downsync:map[] Upsync:[]}
I0412 15:20:43.241674   94634 map-types.go:342] "Delete" map="where" key="1i1weo8uoea04wxr:edge-placement-c"
```

After that, the SyncerConfig in the florin mailbox should be empty, as
in the following (you mailbox workspace names may be different).

```shell
kubectl ws root:espw
```
``` { .bash .no-copy }
Current workspace is "root:espw".
```

```shell
kubectl ws $(kubectl get workspace | sed -n '2p' | awk '{print $1}')
```
``` { .bash .no-copy }
Current workspace is "root:espw:2lplrryirmv4xug3-mb-89c08764-01ae-4117-8fb0-6b752e76bc2f" (type root:universal).
```

```shell
kubectl get SyncerConfig the-one -o yaml
```
``` { .bash .no-copy }
apiVersion: edge.kcp.io/v1alpha1
kind: SyncerConfig
metadata:
  annotations:
    kcp.io/cluster: 2cow9p3xogak4n0u
  creationTimestamp: "2023-04-11T04:34:22Z"
  generation: 4
  name: the-one
  resourceVersion: "2130"
  uid: 2b66b4bc-4130-4bf0-8524-73d6885f2ad8
spec:
  namespaceScope: {}
status: {}
```

And the SyncerConfig in the guilder mailbox workspace should reflect
only the special workload.  That would look something like the
following.

```shell
kubectl ws root:espw
kubectl ws $(kubectl get workspace | sed -n '2p' | awk '{print $1}')
```
``` { .bash .no-copy }
Current workspace is "root:espw:1xpg93182scl85te-mb-5ee1c42e-a7d5-4363-ba10-2f13fe578e19" (type root:universal).
```
