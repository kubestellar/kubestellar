![Boxes and arrows. Two kind clusters exist, named florin and guilder. The Inventory Management workspace contains two pairs of SyncTarget and Location objects. The Edge Service Provider workspace contains the PoC controllers; the mailbox controller reads the SyncTarget objects and creates two mailbox workspaces.](../Edge-PoC-2023q1-Scenario-1-stage-1.svg "Stage 1 Summary")

Stage 1 creates the infrastructure and the edge service provider
workspace (ESPW) and lets that react to the inventory.  Then the KubeStellar syncers
are deployed, in the edge clusters and configured to work with the
corresponding mailbox workspaces.  This stage has the following steps.

### Create two kind clusters.

This example uses two [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) clusters as
edge clusters.  We will call them "florin" and "guilder".

This example uses extremely simple workloads, which
use `hostPort` networking in Kubernetes.  To make those ports easily
reachable from your host, this example uses an explicit `kind`
configuration for each edge cluster.

For the florin cluster, which will get only one workload, create a
file named `florin-config.yaml` with the following contents.  In a
`kind` config file, `containerPort` is about the container that is
also a host (a Kubernetes node), while the `hostPort` is about the
host that hosts that container.

```shell
cat > florin-config.yaml << EOF
kind: Cluster
apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
nodes:
- role: control-plane
  extraPortMappings:
  - containerPort: 8081
    hostPort: 8094
EOF
```

For the guilder cluster, which will get two workloads, create a file
named `guilder-config.yaml` with the following contents.  The workload
that uses hostPort 8081 goes in both clusters, while the workload that
uses hostPort 8082 goes only in the guilder cluster.

```shell
cat > guilder-config.yaml << EOF
kind: Cluster
apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
nodes:
- role: control-plane
  extraPortMappings:
  - containerPort: 8081
    hostPort: 8096
  - containerPort: 8082
    hostPort: 8097
EOF
```

Finally, create the two clusters with the following two commands,
paying attention to `$KUBECONFIG` and, if that's empty,
`~/.kube/config`: `kind create` will inject/replace the relevant
"context" in your active kubeconfig.

```shell
kind create cluster --name florin --config florin-config.yaml
kind create cluster --name guilder --config guilder-config.yaml
```
