#### Get KubeStellar

You will need a local copy of KubeStellar.  You can either use the
pre-built archive (containing executables and config files) from a
release or get any desired version from GitHub and build.

##### Use pre-built archive

Fetch the archive for your operating system and instruction set
architecture as follows, in which `$kubestellar_version` is your
chosen release of KubeStellar (see [the releases on
GitHub](https://github.com/kubestellar/kubestellar/releases)) and
`$os_type` and `$arch_type` are chosen according to the list of
"assets" for your chosen release.

```{.base}
curl -SL -o kubestellar.tar.gz "https://github.com/kubestellar/kubestellar/releases/download/${kubestellar_version}/kubestellar_${kubestellar_version}_${os_type}_${arch_type}.tar.gz
tar xzf kubestellar.tar.gz
export PATH=$PWD/bin:$PATH
```

##### Get from GitHub

You can get the latest version from GitHub with the following command,
which will get you the default branch (which is named "main"); add `-b
$branch` to the `git` command in order to get a different branch.

```{.base}
git clone {{ config.repo_url }}
cd kubestellar
```

Use the following commands to build and add the executables to your
`$PATH`.

```shell
make build
export PATH=$(pwd)/bin:$PATH
```

In the following exhibited command lines, the commands described as
"KubeStellar commands" and the commands that start with `kubectl
kubestellar` rely on the KubeStellar `bin` directory being on the
`$PATH`.  Alternatively you could invoke them with explicit pathnames.
The kubectl plugin lines use fully specific executables (e.g.,
`kubectl kubestellar prep-for-syncer` corresponds to
`bin/kubectl-kubestellar-prep_for_syncer`).

#### Get binaries of kube-bind and dex
The command below makes kube-bind binaries and dex binary available in `$PATH`.

```shell
rm -rf kube-bind
rm -rf kube-bind-autobind
git clone https://github.com/kube-bind/kube-bind.git && \
pushd kube-bind && \
IGNORE_GO_VERSION=1 make build && \
export PATH=$(pwd)/bin:$PATH && \
popd && \
git clone -b autobind https://github.com/waltforme/kube-bind.git kube-bind-autobind && \
pushd kube-bind-autobind && \
IGNORE_GO_VERSION=1 go build -o ../kube-bind/bin/kubectl-bind cmd/kubectl-bind/main.go && \
popd && \
git clone https://github.com/dexidp/dex.git && \
pushd dex && \
IGNORE_GO_VERSION=1 make build && \
export PATH=$(pwd)/bin:$PATH && \
popd && \
cp ./kube-bind/hack/dex-config-dev.yaml ./dex/dex-config-dev.yaml
```

#### Initialize the KubeStellar platform as bare processes

In this step KubeStellar creates and populates the Edge Service
Provider Workspace (ESPW), which exports the KubeStellar API, and also
augments the `root:compute` workspace from kcp TMC as needed here.
That augmentation consists of adding authorization to update the
relevant `/status` and `/scale` subresources (missing in kcp TMC) and
extending the supported subset of the Kubernetes API for managing
containerized workloads from the four resources built into kcp TMC
(`Deployment`, `Pod`, `Service`, and `Ingress`) to the other ones that
are meaningful in KubeStellar.

```shell
kubestellar init
```

### Deploy kcp and KubeStellar as a workload in a Kubernetes cluster

(This style of deployment requires release v0.6 or later of KubeStellar.)

You need a Kubernetes cluster; see [the documentation for `kubectl kubestellar deploy`](../../commands/#deployment-into-a-kubernetes-cluster) for more information.

You will need a domain name that, on each of your clients, resolves to
an IP address that the client can use to open a TCP connection to the
Ingress controller's listening socket.

You will need the kcp `kubectl` plugins.  See [the "Start kcp" section
above](../#start-kcp) for instructions on how to get all of the kcp
executables.

You will need to get a build of KubeStellar.  See
[above](../#get-kubestellar).

To do the deployment and prepare to use it you will be using [the
commands defined for
that](../../commands/#deployment-into-a-kubernetes-cluster).  These
require your shell to be in a state where `kubectl` manipulates the
hosting cluster (the Kubernetes cluster into which you want to deploy
kcp and KubeStellar), either by virtue of having set your `KUBECONFIG`
envar appropriately or putting the relevant contents in
`~/.kube/config` or by passing `--kubeconfig` explicitly on the
following command lines.

Use the [kubectl kubestellar deploy
command](../../commands/#deploy-to-cluster) to do the deployment.

Then use the [kubectl kubestellar get-external-kubeconfig
command](../../commands/#fetch-kubeconfig-for-external-clients) to put
into a file the kubeconfig that you will use as a user of kcp and
KubeStellar.  Do not overwrite the kubeconfig file for your hosting
cluster.  But _do_ update your `KUBECONFIG` envar setting or remember
to pass the new file with `--kubeconfig` on the command lines when
using kcp or KubeStellar. For example, you might use the following
commands to fetch and start using that kubeconfig file; the first
assumes that you deployed the core into a Kubernetes namespace named
"kubestellar".

```{.base}
kubectl kubestellar get-external-kubeconfig -n kubestellar -o kcs.kubeconfig
export KUBECONFIG=$(pwd)/kcs.kubeconfig
```

Note that you now care about two different kubeconfig files: the one
that you were using earlier, which holds the contexts for your `kind`
clusters, and the one that you just fetched and started using for
working with the KubeStellar interface. The remainder of this document
assumes that your `kind` cluster contexts are in `~/.kube/config`.

### Create SyncTarget and Location objects to represent the florin and guilder clusters

Use the following two commands to put inventory objects in the IMW at
`root:imw1` that was automatically created during deployment of
KubeStellar. They label both florin and guilder with `env=prod`, and
also label guilder with `extended=yes`.

```shell
kubectl ws root:imw1
kubectl kubestellar ensure location florin  loc-name=florin  env=prod
kubectl kubestellar ensure location guilder loc-name=guilder env=prod extended=yes
echo "decribe the florin location object"
kubectl describe location.edge.kubestellar.io florin
```

Those two script invocations are equivalent to creating the following
four objects plus the kcp `APIBinding` objects that import the
definition of the KubeStellar API.

```yaml
apiVersion: edge.kubestellar.io/v2alpha1
kind: SyncTarget
metadata:
  name: florin
  labels:
    id: florin
    loc-name: florin
    env: prod
---
apiVersion: edge.kubestellar.io/v2alpha1
kind: Location
metadata:
  name: florin
  labels:
    loc-name: florin
    env: prod
spec:
  resource: {group: edge.kubestellar.io, version: v2alpha1, resource: synctargets}
  instanceSelector:
    matchLabels: {id: florin}
---
apiVersion: edge.kubestellar.io/v2alpha1
kind: SyncTarget
metadata:
  name: guilder
  labels:
    id: guilder
    loc-name: guilder
    env: prod
    extended: yes
---
apiVersion: edge.kubestellar.io/v2alpha1
kind: Location
metadata:
  name: guilder
  labels:
    loc-name: guilder
    env: prod
    extended: yes
spec:
  resource: {group: edge.kubestellar.io, version: v2alpha1, resource: synctargets}
  instanceSelector:
    matchLabels: {id: guilder}
```

That script also deletes the Location named `default`, which is not
used in this PoC, if it shows up.
