## Stage 4

![Syncer effects](../Edge-PoC-2023q1-Scenario-1-stage-4.svg "Stage 4 summary")

In Stage 4, the edge syncer does its thing.  Actually, it should have
done it as soon as the relevant inputs became available in stage 3.
Now we examine what happened.

You can check that the workloads are running in the edge clusters as
they should be.

The syncer does its thing between the phineas cluster and its mailbox
workspace.  This is driven by the `SyncerConfig` object named
`the-one` in that mailbox workspace.

The syncer does its thing between the ferb cluster and its mailbox
workspace.  This is driven by the `SyncerConfig` object named
`the-one` in that mailbox workspace.

Using the kubeconfig that `kind` modified, examine the phineas cluster.
Find just the `commonstuff` namespace and the `commond` Deployment.

```shell
( KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config
  let tries=1
  while ! kubectl --context kind-phineas get ns commonstuff &> /dev/null; do
    if (( tries >= 30)); then
      echo "The commonstuff namespace failed to appear in phineas!" >&2
      exit 10
    fi
    let tries=tries+1
    sleep 10
  done
  kubectl --context kind-phineas get ns
)
```
``` { .bash .no-copy }
NAME                                 STATUS   AGE

```

``` {.bash .hide-me}
sleep 15
```

```shell
KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config kubectl --context kind-phineas get deploy,rs -A | egrep 'NAME|stuff'
```
``` { .bash .no-copy }
NAMESPACE                            NAME                                                 READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
NAMESPACE                            NAME                                                            DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
commonstuff                          replicaset.apps/commond                                         1         1         1       13m
```

Examine the ferb cluster.  Find both workload namespaces and both
Deployments.

``` {.bash .hide-me}
sleep 15
```

```shell
KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config kubectl --context kind-ferb get ns | egrep NAME\|stuff
```
``` { .bash .no-copy }
NAME                               STATUS   AGE
commonstuff                        Active   8m33s
specialstuff                       Active   8m33s
```

```shell
KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config kubectl --context kind-ferb get deploy,rs -A | egrep NAME\|stuff
```
``` { .bash .no-copy }
NAMESPACE                             NAME                                                  READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
specialstuff                          deployment.apps/speciald                              1/1     1            1           23m
NAMESPACE                             NAME                                                            DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
commonstuff                           replicaset.apps/commond                                         1         1         1       23m
specialstuff                          replicaset.apps/speciald-76cdbb69b5                             1         1         1       14s
```

Examining the common workload in the ferb cluster, for example,
will show that the replacement-style customization happened.

``` {.bash .hide-me}
sleep 15
```

```shell
KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config kubectl --context kind-ferb get rs -n commonstuff commond -o yaml
```
``` { .bash .no-copy }
...
      containers:
      - env:
        - name: EXAMPLE_VAR
          value: env is prod
        image: library/httpd:2.4
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        name: httpd
...
```

Check that the common workload on the phineas cluster is working.

```shell
let tries=1
while ! curl http://localhost:8094 &> /dev/null; do
  if (( tries >= 30 )); then
    echo "The common workload failed to come up on phineas!" >&2
    exit 10
  fi
  let tries=tries+1
  sleep 10
done
curl http://localhost:8094
```
``` { .bash .no-copy }
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    This is a common web site.
    Running in phineas.
  </body>
</html>
```

Check that the special workload on the ferb cluster is working.
```shell
let tries=1
while ! curl http://localhost:8097 &> /dev/null; do
  if (( tries >= 30 )); then
    echo "The special workload failed to come up on ferb!" >&2
    exit 10
  fi
  let tries=tries+1
  sleep 10
done
curl http://localhost:8097
```
``` { .bash .no-copy }
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    This is a special web site.
    Running in ferb.

```

Check that the common workload on the ferb cluster is working.

```shell
let tries=1
while ! curl http://localhost:8096 &> /dev/null; do
  if (( tries >= 30 )); then
    echo "The common workload failed to come up on ferb!" >&2
    exit 10
  fi
  let tries=tries+1
  sleep 10
done
curl http://localhost:8096
```
``` { .bash .no-copy }
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

    This is a common web site.
