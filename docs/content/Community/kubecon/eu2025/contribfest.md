We’re thrilled to be hosting a Contribfest session at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2025 in London, UK! Join us on Thursday, April 3, 2025, from 4:00pm to 5:15pm BST in ExceL London, Level 3 | ICC Capital Suite 1.

As a Sandbox CNCF project, KubeStellar is at an exciting stage of growth, and there’s never been a better time to get involved as an open-source contributor. In this post, we’ll explain what Contribfest is, highlight some beginner-friendly issues, and show you how you can join the fun, whether you're attending in London or contributing remotely.

### What is Contribfest?
Contribfest is an interactive session where attendees can collaborate with project maintainers and community contributors to tackle beginner-friendly issues, hunt bugs, discuss feature ideas, and even pair program to contribute directly to CNCF projects.

At this year’s KubeStellar Contribfest, project maintainers will guide contributors of all experience levels through the KubeStellar codebase, share insights into its architecture, and help attendees make their first contributions to this groundbreaking project for multicluster application orchestration.

Whether you're new to KubeStellar or ready to dive deep, you'll have the chance to get familiar with the KubeStellar developer experience, work side-by-side with maintainers, and become part of the community driving innovation in the cloud-native ecosystem.
