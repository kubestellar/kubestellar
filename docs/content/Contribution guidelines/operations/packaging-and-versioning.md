# Packaging and Versioning

This document surveys the various sorts of piles of things that exist
in KubeStellar and how they are versioned.

![outline of things](KubeStellar-Versioned-and-Distributed-Things.svg)

The picture above outlines the situation. The thing at the tail of an
arrow refers to or in some way consumes from the thing at the head of
the arrow. Some details omitted for brevity: the full release
archives, the Kubernetes API group, and the space framework component.


## Kubernetes API group

KubeStellar defines a Kubernetes [API
group](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/#api-groups),
named `control.kubestellar.io`. API groups are versioned; see [the
Kubernetes documentation on API group
versioning](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/#api-versioning). The
Kubernetes API of KubeStellar is defined in `api/control`.

The API objects form the interface between users and the controllers
that implement the semantics of those objects.

## Syncer container image

The syncer is KubeStellar's agent in WECs, and is based on a
Kubernetes Pod that uses a container image at
`quay.io/kubestellar/syncer`. This container image is built from
contents of [the KubeStellar GitHub
repo](https://github.com/kubestellar/kubestellar) focused by
[ko](https://github.com/ko-build/ko) on the syncer binary. This image
is normally built using the `make` target named
"build-kubestellar-syncer-image. The syncer image is referenced in the
output generated by the `kubectl kubestellar syncer-gen` command,
which is invoked by `kubectl kubestellar prep-for-syncer`, which is
invoked by `kubectl kubestellar prep-for-cluster`. The `kubectl
kubestellar prep-for-syncer` script holds the default value for the
tag to use in the reference to the syncer image.

Following are some recent tags and what they correspond to.

- `v0.9.0`, for the git commit with that tag (i.e., that release).

- `v0.8.0`, for the git commit with that tag (i.e., that release).

- `pr-1103` = `git-ae64d5722-clean`, incorporating [PR
  1103](https://github.com/kubestellar/kubestellar/pull/1103), the
  latest development in the release-0.7 line.

## Core container image

The core container image is used in containers that run the KubeStellar core controllers
, initialize the KubeStellar core, and run one of the supported space providers. It is built from some
contents of [the KubeStellar GitHub
repo](https://github.com/kubestellar/kubestellar), specifically
excluding some that are only needed by users outside this
container. This image is normally built using the `make` target
"kubestellar-image". This image is referenced from the core Helm
chart, which can be used directly from the Helm repo and also is used
by the `kubectl kubestellar deploy` command (which has a fixed image
tag in its source, which is edited when it is time to advance that
tag).

Following are some recent tags and what they correspond to.

- `release-0.9`, for the release 0.9 line of development; currently
  this points to the same image as `v0.9.0`
  but may move in the future.

- `v0.9.0` = `v0.9.0-alpha.1.git1f0e2cc-clean`, for the v0.9.0 release.

## KubeStellar core Helm chart

This Helm chart describes a deployment of the KubeStellar core
components (a space provider, KubeStellar controllers, initialization) as
workload for a Kubernetes cluster.

The source of this Helm chart is in the `core-helm-chart` subdirectory
of the [kubestellar GitHub repo](#kubestellarkubestellar).

The `kubectl kubestellar deploy` command uses the adjacent copy of
this Helm chart. That is: (1) in the case of working with a local copy
of the kubestellar/kubestellar GitHub repo, the copy in the
`core-helm-chart` directory, and (2) in the case of using an unpacked
release archive --- which contains `core-helm-chart` as well as `bin`
--- that unpacked copy of `core-helm-chart`.

Alternatively, users can use the Helm repository at
`https://helm.kubestellar.io/`, which is served via GitHub pages from
the `main` branch of [the kubestellar/helm GitHub
repo](#kubestellarhelm). This repository holds tar archives of
released versions of the chart, created manually from the sources in
the `core-helm-chart` subdirectory of the [kubestellar GitHub
repo](#kubestellarkubestellar).

A Helm chart has both a version number for the chart itself and a
version number for the "application" it installs.

Currently there is only one version of the chart that is interesting.

| Chart Version | App Version | What it is |
| ------------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| 1/2 (some confusion here) |     v0.9.0  | KubeStellar release-0.9 branch |

## GitHub repos

### kubestellar/kubestellar

The [kubestellar](https://GitHub.com/kubestellar/kubestellar) repo is
the main repo for KubeStellar. It holds the code and documentation and
the source of the Helm chart. The following branches and tags are most
interesting.

- branch `main` is the main line of development.
- branch `release-0.9` is for development along the line of the 0.9 release.
- tag `v0.9.0` is release 0.9.0.

### kubestellar/helm

The [helm](https://GitHub.com/kubestellar/helm) GitHub repo hosts
distributions of archived versions of the chart, as discussed
[above](#kubestellar-core-helm-chart).

### kubestellar/homebrew-kubestellar

The
[homebrew-kubestellar](https://GitHub.com/kubestellar/homebrew-kubestellar)
GitHub repo serves directly as the homebrew repository for
KubeStellar. According to homebrew convention, users refer to it in
homebrew as `kubestellar/kubestellar` (e.g., `brew tap
kubestellar/kubestellar` connects directly to this GitHub repository).

This HomeBrew repository has two formulae.  One to control the space
provider and another formula called `kubestellar_cli` containing tools needed by a
user who deploys the KubeStellar core as workload in a Kubernetes
cluster or another user of that deployment. This formula fetches and
installs a `kubestellaruser` release archive from GitHub. Users invoke
the `brew` command directly to install, upgrade, and remove these
formulae.

Following are the versions available.

- `kubestellar_cli` `v0.9.0`, for that release of KubeStellar.

### kubestellar/kubeflex

The [kubeflex](https://GitHub.com/kubestellar/kubeflex) repo holds
kubeflex, an independent component that we anticipate using as a
provider for the Space framework in the future.
