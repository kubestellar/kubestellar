<!-- # Contributing to KCP-Edge -->
<p>Greetings! We are grateful for your interest in joining the KCP-Edge community and making a positive impact. Whether you&rsquo;re raising issues, enhancing documentation, fixing bugs, or developing new features, your contributions are essential to our success.</p>
<p>To get started, kindly read through this document and familiarize yourself with our code of conduct. If you have any inquiries, please feel free to reach out to us on <a href="https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C021U8WSAFK">Slack</a>.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t wait to collaborate with you!</p>
<h2 id="contributing-code">Contributing Code</h2>
<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>
<p><a href="https://golang.org/doc/install">Install Go</a> 1.19+.</p>
<p>Check out our <a href="/docs/getting-started/quickstart/">Quickstart Guide</a></p>
<h3 id="issues">Issues</h3>
<p>Prioritization for pull requests is given to those that address and resolve existing GitHub issues. Utilize the available issue labels to identify meaningful and relevant issues to work on.</p>
<p>If you believe that there is a need for a fix and no existing issue covers it, feel free to create a new one.</p>
<p>As a new contributor, we encourage you to start with issues labeled as good first issues.</p>
<p>Your assistance in improving documentation is highly valued, regardless of your level of experience with the project.</p>
<p>To claim an issue that you are interested in, kindly leave a comment on the issue and request the maintainers to assign it to you.</p>
<h3 id="committing">Committing</h3>
<p>We encourage all contributors to adopt <a href="https://www.futurelearn.com/info/blog/telling-stories-with-your-git-history">best practices in git commit management</a> to facilitate efficient reviews and retrospective analysis. Your git commits should provide ample context for reviewers and future codebase readers.</p>
<p>A recommended format for final commit messages is as follows:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>{Short Title}: {Problem this commit is solving and any important contextual information} {issue number if applicable}
</code></pre><h3 id="pull-requests">Pull Requests</h3>
<p>When submitting a pull request, clear communication is appreciated. This can be achieved by providing the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Detailed description of the problem you are trying to solve, along with links to related GitHub issues</li>
<li>Explanation of your solution, including links to any design documentation and discussions</li>
<li>Information on how you tested and validated your solution</li>
<li>Updates to relevant documentation and examples, if applicable</li>
</ul>
<p>The pull request template has been designed to assist you in communicating this information effectively.</p>
<p>Smaller pull requests are typically easier to review and merge than larger ones. If your pull request is big, it is always recommended to collaborate with the maintainers to find the best way to divide it.</p>
<p>Approvers will review your PR within a business day. A PR requires both an /lgtm and then an /approve in order to get merged. You may /approve your own PR but you may not /lgtm it. Automation will add the PR it to the OpenShift PR merge queue. The OpenShift Tide bot will automatically merge your work when it is available.</p>
<p>Congratulations! Your pull request has been successfully merged! 👏</p>
<p>If you have any questions about contributing, don&rsquo;t hesitate to reach out to us on the KCP-dev <a href="https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C021U8WSAFK">Slack channel</a>.</p>

where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
as of the date such litigation is filed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the

Derivative Works a copy of this License; and</p>
<p>(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
stating that You changed the files; and</p>

wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
as modifying the License.</p>
<p>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
the conditions stated in this License.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of

WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions

unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this

defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</p>
