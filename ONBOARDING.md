KubeStellar GitHub Organization
On-boarding and Off-boarding Policy

Effective Date: June 1st, 2023

  At KubeStellar we love our contributors.  Our contributors can make various valuable contributions to our project. They can actively engage in code development by submitting pull requests, implementing new features, or fixing bugs. Additionally, contributors can assist with testing, CICD, documentation, providing clear and comprehensive guides, tutorials, and examples. Moreover, they can contribute to the project by participating in discussions, offering feedback, and helping to improve overall community engagement and collaboration.
