    "faq3Q": "Do I need to install all prerequisites?",
    "faq3A": "For basic KubeStellar usage, you only need the Core prerequisites. Install Additional prerequisites if you want to run examples. Build prerequisites are only needed for development and building from source.",
    "faq4Q": "Can I use KubeStellar with existing Kubernetes clusters?",
    "faq4A": "Yes! KubeStellar can manage existing Kubernetes clusters. You can connect your production clusters alongside local development clusters for unified multi-cluster management.",
    "faq5Q": "What are the minimum system requirements?",
    "faq5A": "KubeStellar requires at least 4GB RAM and 2 CPU cores. You'll need Docker (v20.0+), kubectl (v1.27+), and either kind (v0.20+) or k3d for local clusters."
