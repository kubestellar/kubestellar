# Usage: $0 $commit

# This will `git checkout $commit`,
# make copy in subdirectory `$PWD/forcount`,
# remove subdirectories that should not be counted,
# then apply `count-tree.sh $PWD/counts $commit $timestamp`.
# The timestamp is found by `git show --no-patch --no-notes --format=%ct`.

# Note that this script navigates to subsidiary scripts in the same
# directory that this script is executing from.
# Thus, if you make a copy of hack outside the git directory
# then you can invoke that copy of this script.
