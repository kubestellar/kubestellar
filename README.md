**KubeStellar** is a Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) Sandbox project that simplifies the deployment and configuration of applications across multiple Kubernetes clusters. It provides a seamless experience akin to using a single cluster, and it integrates with the tools you're already familiar with, eliminating the need to modify existing resources.

KubeStellar is particularly beneficial if you're currently deploying in a single cluster and are looking to expand to multiple clusters, or if you're already using multiple clusters and are seeking a more streamlined developer experience.


![KubeStellar High Level View](docs/content/images/kubestellar-high-level.png)


The use of multiple clusters offers several advantages, including:

- Separation of environments (e.g., development, testing, staging)
- Isolation of groups, teams, or departments
- Compliance with enterprise security or data governance requirements
- Enhanced resiliency, including across different clouds
- Improved resource availability
- Access to heterogeneous resources
- Capability to run applications on the edge, including in disconnected environments

In a single-cluster setup, developers typically access the cluster and deploy Kubernetes objects directly. Without KubeStellar, multiple clusters are usually deployed and configured individually, which can be time-consuming and complex.

KubeStellar simplifies this process by allowing developers to define a binding policy between clusters and Kubernetes objects. It then uses your regular single-cluster tooling to deploy and configure each cluster based on these binding policies, making multi-cluster operations as straightforward as managing a single cluster. This approach enhances productivity and efficiency, making KubeStellar a valuable tool in a multi-cluster Kubernetes environment.
